= Sync =

The Python Sync Server is composed of four parts:

* ''server-core'': library containing various helpers. 
* ''server-storage'': the storage server. 
* ''server-reg'': the user registration/management server.
* ''server-full'': a server that reunites the server and the user servers so
you can run everything in a single box.
